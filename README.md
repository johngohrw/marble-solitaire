A board game with simple rules involving movement and elimination of marbles. Marbles can hop over any neighbouring marble into an empty space, and the marble that was hopped over is removed. To win, marbles will have to be eliminated until one last marble remains on the board. 

Comes with a puzzle generator and solver.
